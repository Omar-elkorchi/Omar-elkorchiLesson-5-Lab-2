%% Adding a note 

In order to go surfing several conditions have to be verified regarding the weather the availability of waves and time If it's a sunny day and there is good waves to surf then we can choose a convenient spot In the case that the surfer is available during the 	sunrise hour he can choose a spot to surf near his house If he is available at the sunset then he can choose to surf near his job 	location and if he is lucky enough and he is in vacation in that case he can go to explore new spots

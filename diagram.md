In order to go surfing several conditions have to be verified. Starting by the weather and also the presence of good waves to surf. So if we are in a sunny day and we figured out that there is a good waves then we can go surfing. We start by choosing a convenient spot regarding the time availability. if I am available during the morning I can go to surf in a spot near my house. If I am available after work I can go for a sunset surf near my job location, and finally if I am lucky enough and I am in vacation then I can go to explore new spots.

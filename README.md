After creating an account in the "cloud" GitHub, I have created a new repository (witch a checked Readme) then I downloaded the GitHub desktop and signing the same account used in the cloud GitHub. The last step was clicking on clone repository by selecting the name of the repository created in the cloud and choosing the location of the cloned repository in the desktop.
